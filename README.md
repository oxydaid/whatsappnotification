## ü§î Troubleshooting / FAQ

* **Notifications are not being sent at all.**
    * Ensure your **API Key** and **Sender Number** are correct.
    * Check the formatting of the **Admin Numbers** (use `|` as a separator).
    * Make sure you have selected the events you want to activate in the **"Enable Notifications For Events"** field.
    * Check the Paymenter log file at `storage/logs/laravel.log` for more detailed error messages.

* **Notifications for Customers (Buyers) are not being sent.**
    * Ensure the customer has a valid phone number in their profile. The extension automatically retrieves the number from the user's profile data.

* **I've changed the code, but there are no changes on the website.**
    * Try running the `php artisan cache:clear` command in your server's terminal to clear the cache.
